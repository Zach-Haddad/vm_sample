# Drag and Drop Table

This was a simple code sample made specifically for a coding challenge.  I implemented drag and drop functionality with vanilla JS and jQuery without the use of additional libraries.  Tables were populated via AJAX requests to a dummy API (jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).  Dragging an object from one table to the other initiates a patch request to the dummy API, waits for the response, and then renders the change.  Tables were styled with CSS and jQuery selectors.  Webpack was used to manage dependencies.
